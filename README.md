# collatz-calc
Calculates the collatz sequence with UI for an atmega2560 with LCD shield in C and ASM. Originally for CSC 230 at Uvic

The C and ASM files are independant as the assignments were to write the same program in different languages. Compile ```main.c``` for the C implementation and ```main.asm``` for the same in ASM. The program makes use of an LCD shield like [this](https://i.imgur.com/SGJlCXu.png) to interact with it
